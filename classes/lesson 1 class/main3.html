        In vector calculus, the gradient of a scalar-valued differentiable 
        function of several variables is the vector field whose 
        value at a point gives the direction and the rate of fastest increase

        <p> gradient. noun. 
            1. : change in the value of a quantity (as temperature, pressure, or concentration) 
            with change in a given variable and especially per unit on a linear scale </p>

            <p>The gradient equation is another way we refer to the gradient 
             of a straight line using x and y coordinates. 
            So again the gradient equation is seen as m = rise / run 
            where m is the gradient or slope.</p>
